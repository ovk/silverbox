=== Software and Services
This is the list of services running on the server that are described in this document:

- *Unbound* as a forwarding DNS server that forwards queries to the DNS server of your choice and uses DNS-over-TLS and DNSSEC for
extra security and privacy.
- *NFS server* secured with Kerberos (clean NFSv4-only server).
- *Nextcloud* accessible over HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates (renewed automatically using Certbot with DNS challenge).
- *Transmission* BitTorent client that communicates only over a VPN connection.
- *SOCKS5 proxy server* that proxies traffic securely over a VPN connection.
- *Git server* for hosting Git repositories.
- *Borg and Rclone* for automatic encrypted incremental backups (both on-site and off-site).
- *Reverse proxy server* with HTTPS (using wildcard certificate) and basic authentication to access internal services.
- *Monit* for system monitoring and notifications.
- Script to automatically update DNS record pointing to server's public IP address (in case of dynamic IP).

The server also runs:

- SSH server.
- Docker engine (as most of the workloads are run as containers).
