## [1.3.1] - 2022-03-27

- Update images [899175e]
  Note that newer versions of Docker use BuildKit by default, which may fail to build compose files that use custom networks.
  If you see an error message similar to this: "network mode "common" not supported by buildkit. You can define a custom network for your builder using the network driver-opt in buildx create."
  try disabling BuildKit by settings environment variable DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0.

## [1.3.0] - 2022-01-09

- Update Docker images [0a92490]
    - Update Nextcloud to 23.0.0 and PostgreSQL to 14.1
    Note that due to major version upgrade for PostgreSQL manual DB conversion is required:
        - Stop Nextcloud completely and backup its database by making a copy of /src/nextcloud/db directory.
        - Start nextcloud-db container and create a DB dump:
        $ sudo docker exec -i nextcloud-db pg_dumpall --username nextcloud --clean > nextcloud_db.sql
        - Stop nextcloud-db container, edit Nextcloud Docker Compose file and update the DB image to 14.1
        - Delete everythin inside /srv/nextcloud/db directory
        - Start the new nextcloud-db container using Docker Compose
        - Restore the DB from the dump:
        $ sudo docker exec -i nextcloud-db psql --username nextcloud nextcloud < nextcloud_db.sql
        - After the restore completes, stop the nextcloud-db container and replace host auth method back to md5 by editing /srv/nextcloud/db/pg_hba.conf file:
            host all all all md5
        - Start all Nextcloud containers

    - Update Firefly III to 5.5.13 and PostgreSQL to 14.1
    Note that due to major version upgrade for PostgreSQL manual DB conversion is required:
        - Stop firefly-app and firefly-db containers and backup the database by making a copy of /srv/firefly/db directory.
        - Start firefly-db container and create a DB dump:
        $ sudo docker exec -i firefly-db pg_dumpall --username firefly --clean > firefly_db.sql
        - Stop firefly-db container, edit Firefly Docker Compose file and update the DB image to 14.1
        - Delete everythin inside /srv/firefly/db directory
        - Start the new firefly-db container using Docker Compose
        - Restore the DB from the dump:
        $ sudo docker exec -i firefly-db psql --username firefly firefly < firefly_db.sql
        - After the restore completes, stop the firefly-db container and replace host auth method back to md5 by editing /srv/firefly/db/pg_hba.conf file:
            host all all all md5
        - Start all Firefly containers

- Update to Docker Compose v2 [7323225]
  Note that Docker compose v2 command is 'docker compose' as opposed to 'docker-compose'.
  There are few places in the document where 'docker-compose' needs to be manually replaced with the 'docker compose'
  (for example, in systemctl units for starting up containers).
  The easiest way to find these places is to search for the 'docker compose' string.

## [1.0.2] - 2020-10-10

- Update Nextcloud to 19.0.4-fpm and Postgres to 13.0 [b53d512]
  Note that due to major version upgrade for PostgreSQL manual DB conversion is required:
    - First stop Nextcloud and backup its database (for example, by making a copy of /srv/nextcloud/db directory). Then start it again.
    - Unfortunately, there is no easy upgrade path between major PostgreSQL versions (see https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues/37 issue) when using Docker.
      One way would be to use pg_upgrade (for example, see https://github.com/tianon/docker-postgres-upgrade) but it appears to be unreliable.
      The easiest way seems to be to just dump and restore database:
        - Stop nextcloud-web and nextcloud-fpm containers
        - Create a full dump of the DB using currently running nextcloud-db container:
          $ sudo docker exec -i nextcloud-db pg_dumpall --username nextcloud --clean > db_dump.sql
        - Stop nextcloud-db container, edit Nextcloud docker-compose.yml file and update DB image to desired version (13.0)
        - Delete everything inside /srv/nextcloud/db directory (make sure you have backup of it before doing this)
        - Start new nextcloud-db container with the new PostgreSQL version
        - Restore the DB from the dump:
          $ sudo docker exec -i nextcloud-db psql --username nextcloud nextcloud < db_dump.sql
        - After restore completes the nextcloud-web and nextcloud-fpm containers can be started back up

## [1.0.1] - 2020-09-14

- Update Nextcloud to 19.0.3-fpm and Postgres to 12.4 [23293c2]

## [1.0.0] - 2020-08-16

- Add preamble and icon. Improve some sections. Fix typos. [af07d23]
- Move ToC on the left [f7046dd]
- Removed workaround for nextcloud/docker bug #345 as it now fixed [c5e2aef]
- Update Nextcloud to 19.0.1. Fix nextcloud-fpm container. [0121898]
- Put Nextcloud to maintenance mode during backup [3165e48]
- Switch away from Alpine to Debian Docker images [41d46b0]
  * All Alpine images replaced with Debian (slim) images.
    Note that for two Nextcloud containers (HTTPD and Postgres) the update
    requires manual UID/GID update, as Debian uses different UID/GID for
    users postgres and www-data. To do the update, stop Nextcloud, and then
    run the following commands before starting it again with Debian based
    images:
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -uid 82 -exec chown 33 {} \;
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -gid 82 -exec chgrp 33 {} \;
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -uid 70 -exec chown 999 {} \;
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -gid 70 -exec chgrp 999 {} \;
  * Apache HTTPD updated to 2.4.46
  * Use build-in Docker init (added in Docker 19) instead of Tini
