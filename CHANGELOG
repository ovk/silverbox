## [1.0.2] - 2020-10-10

- Update Nextcloud to 19.0.4-fpm and Postgres to 13.0 [b53d512]
  Note that due to major version upgrade for PostgreSQL manual DB conversion is required:
    - First stop Nextcloud and backup its database (for example, by making a copy of /srv/nextcloud/db directory). Then start it again.
    - Unfortunately, there is no easy upgrade path between major PostgreSQL versions (see https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/issues/37 issue) when using Docker.
      One way would be to use pg_upgrade (for example, see https://github.com/tianon/docker-postgres-upgrade) but it appears to be unreliable.
      The easiest way seems to be to just dump and restore database:
        - Stop nextcloud-web and nextcloud-fpm containers
        - Create a full dump of the DB using currently running nextcloud-db container:
          $ sudo docker exec -i nextcloud-db pg_dumpall --username nextcloud --clean > db_dump.sql
        - Stop nextcloud-db container, edit Nextcloud docker-compose.yml file and update DB image to desired version (13.0)
        - Delete everything inside /srv/nextcloud/db directory (make sure you have backup of it before doing this)
        - Start new nextcloud-db container with the new PostgreSQL version
        - Restore the DB from the dump:
          $ sudo docker exec -i nextcloud-db psql --username nextcloud nextcloud < db_dump.sql
        - After restore completes the nextcloud-web and nextcloud-fpm containers can be started back up

## [1.0.1] - 2020-09-14

- Update Nextcloud to 19.0.3-fpm and Postgres to 12.4 [23293c2]

## [1.0.0] - 2020-08-16

- Add preamble and icon. Improve some sections. Fix typos. [af07d23]
- Move ToC on the left [f7046dd]
- Removed workaround for nextcloud/docker bug #345 as it now fixed [c5e2aef]
- Update Nextcloud to 19.0.1. Fix nextcloud-fpm container. [0121898]
- Put Nextcloud to maintenance mode during backup [3165e48]
- Switch away from Alpine to Debian Docker images [41d46b0]
  * All Alpine images replaced with Debian (slim) images.
    Note that for two Nextcloud containers (HTTPD and Postgres) the update
    requires manual UID/GID update, as Debian uses different UID/GID for
    users postgres and www-data. To do the update, stop Nextcloud, and then
    run the following commands before starting it again with Debian based
    images:
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -uid 82 -exec chown 33 {} \;
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -gid 82 -exec chgrp 33 {} \;
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -uid 70 -exec chown 999 {} \;
        sudo find /srv/nextcloud -gid 70 -exec chgrp 999 {} \;
  * Apache HTTPD updated to 2.4.46
  * Use build-in Docker init (added in Docker 19) instead of Tini
