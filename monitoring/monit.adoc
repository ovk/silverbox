=== Monit
This section describes Monit installation and configuration for monitoring basic system parameters (such as
CPU and RAM utilization, temperatures, etc.).
Monitoring of specific services (e.g. DNS server, Docker, Nextcloud) is described in the corresponding sections.
For example, section on DNS server setup describes how to add DNS server monitoring to Monit.

==== Installation
Monit can be installed directly from the repositories:

----
sudo apt install monit
----

This will create and start Systemd service for Monit. Its status can be checked with:

----
systemctl status monit
----

After installation, create a directory where custom scripts for Monit will be stored:

----
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts
----

==== Configuration
The main Monit configuration file is located at `/etc/monit/monitrc`.
The defaults there are pretty sensible, but of course you can adjust them if you need to.
For example, to set check interval and startup delay to one minute:

----
set daemon 60
  with start delay 60
----

===== CPU Temperature Script
System temperatures can be read directly from `procfs`, but using `lm-sensors` package makes it more convenient to parse.
To install the `lm-sensors` package:

----
sudo apt install lm-sensors
----

As `root` user, create CPU temperature monitoring script `/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/cpu_temp.sh` with the following content:

./usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/cpu_temp.sh
[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
RET=`sensors -Au 2> /dev/null | sed -n 's/_input//p' | sed 's/.\+:\s\+\([0-9]\+\).\+/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1`
exit $RET
----

And mark it as executable:
----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/cpu_temp.sh
----

This script simply finds the maximum temperature reported by all temperature sensors and returns it as exit code.
If you using different hardware, you may need to modify this script.

===== Disk Temperature Script
As `root` user, create disk temperature monitoring script `/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/disk_temp.sh` with the following content:

./usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/disk_temp.sh
[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
UUID="$1"
DEV=$(readlink -f /dev/disk/by-uuid/"$UUID")
RET=`hddtemp -n SATA:"$DEV" 2> /dev/null`
exit $RET
----

And mark it as executable:

----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/disk_temp.sh
----

Similarly to previous script, this one also reads the temperature and returns it as the exit code.

NOTE: For some SSDs (notably for Samsung EVO ones), the temperature data is returned in different smart field.
Some extra configuration may be required for `hddtemp` to read temperature data from such drives.
More details can be found in the Arch Wiki article on `hddtemp` <<arch_wiki_hddtemp>>.

===== UPS Battery Charge Script
As `root` user, create UPS battery monitoring script `/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/ups_charge.sh` with the following content:

./usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/ups_charge.sh
[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh
RET=`upsc eaton3s battery.charge 2> /dev/null` # <1>
exit $RET
----
<1> Replace `eaton3s` with your UPS name, exactly as it was configured in NUT.

And mark it as executable:

----
sudo chmod u+x /usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/ups_charge.sh
----

This script simply returns UPS battery charge value (in percents) as the exit code.

[[basic_system_monitoring]]
===== Basic System Monitoring
To configure basic system monitoring with Monit, as `root` user create `/etc/monit/conf.d/10-system` file
and set its permissions to 600, so that only `root` can read and edit it:

----
sudo touch /etc/monit/conf.d/10-system
sudo chmod 600 /etc/monit/conf.d/10-system
----

Below is a working example of what you can put in this file to establish basic system monitoring with Monit.
Read this file carefully, replace placeholders with the actual values and tweak the parameters as you need:

./etc/monit/conf.d/10-system
[subs="attributes+"]
----
# Log to syslog instead of monit.log
set log syslog

# Set global SSL options
set ssl {
    verify     : enable,
    selfsigned : reject
}

# Listen only locally
set httpd
    port \{MONIT_PORT} # <1>
    use address 127.0.0.1
    allow localhost

# Email address to receive alerts. Ignore trivial alerts.
set alert {SB_EMAIL} not on { instance, action } # <2>

# Set email format
set mail-format {
  from:    Monit <monit@$HOST>
  subject: $EVENT: $SERVICE
  message: $EVENT: $SERVICE
           Date:        $DATE
           Action:      $ACTION
           Host:        $HOST
           Description: $DESCRIPTION
}

# Set mail server
set mailserver {SB_SMTP_ADDR} port {SB_SMTP_PORT} # <3>
    using tls

# System performance

    if loadavg (1min) > 20 then alert
    if loadavg (5min) > 10 then alert
    if loadavg (15min) > 5 then alert
    if memory usage > 70% for 5 cycles then alert
    if swap usage > 5% then alert
    if cpu usage > 70% for 5 cycles then alert

# CPU Temperature

    if status > 60 then alert
    if status < 15 then alert

# UPS battery
check program ups_charge with path "/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/ups_charge.sh"
    if status < 95 then alert
----
<1> Replace `\{MONIT_PORT}` with the port number on which you want Monit to listen for web interface connections.
<2> Replace `{SB_EMAIL}` with email address to which Monit will deliver notifications.
<3> Replace `{SB_SMTP_ADDR}` and `{SB_SMTP_PORT}` with SMTP server address and port respectively.
Usually you can get relaying SMTP server address/port from your ISP.
<4> Replace `\{NET_INTERFACE_NAME}` with your network interface name.
<5> Replace `\{PART_UUID}` with UUID of your `/boot` partition (can be copied from the `/etc/fstab` file).
This is needed in order not to rely on disk device names (e.g. `/dev/sda`) as they can change.

Restart Monit service for the changes to take effect:

----
sudo systemctl restart monit
----

NOTE: You may notice that after running Monit,
the default Message of the Day complains about presence of the zombie processes.
At the moment of writing, when Monit invokes other programs (such as in `check program` instruction)
in creates zombie processes by design.
This zombie processes are handled correctly and don't grow over time.
There is an open bug about this issue and hopefully it will be improved in the future releases of Monit.

==== Accessing Monit
Monit can be accessed via command line or web interface.

===== Command Line Interface
To see Monit information in command line try:

----
sudo monit status
----

or

----
sudo monit summary
----

Do `sudo monit -h` to see all available options.

===== Web Interface
In this configuration, Monit only listens for local connections on `127.0.0.1:\{MONIT_PORT}`.
This is done deliberately for security reasons.

One way to access Monit web interface from the outside is to do it through SSH tunnel.
For example, from the client PC establish a SSH tunnel:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
ssh {SB_USER}@{SB_IP} -N -L 127.0.0.1:\{LOCAL_PORT}:127.0.0.1:\{MONIT_PORT}
----

Here `\{LOCAL_PORT}` is port on which SSH will be listening on the client PC.
Web interface now can be accessed on the client pc at `http://127.0.0.1:\{LOCAL_PORT}`.

To create this tunnel in more convenient way, you can add the following entry to your SSH config file `~/.ssh/config`:

.~/.ssh/config
[subs="attributes+"]
----
host silverbox-monit-ui-tunnel
    HostName {SB_IP} # <1>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/silverbox-key
    LocalForward 127.0.0.1:\{LOCAL_PORT} 127.0.0.1:\{MONIT_PORT}
----
<1> IP can be replaced with the host name here after domain is configured.

Now the tunnel can be established simply with:

----
ssh -N silverbox-monit-ui-tunnel
----

NOTE: More convenient way of accessing Monit web interface and other internal services is described in the <<reverse_proxy>> section.
