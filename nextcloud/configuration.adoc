=== Configuration
This section only describes some generic post-install configuration
as your configuration will highly depend on the use case.

==== Fixing Security and Setup Warnings
Navigate to _Settings -> Overview_ page and check the "`Security & setup warnings`" section.

Most likely you'll see at least one warning here: `Some columns in the database are missing a conversion to big int`.
To fix it, run the following commands:

----
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml exec --user www-data nextcloud-fpm php occ maintenance:mode --on
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml exec --user www-data nextcloud-fpm php occ db:convert-filecache-bigint --no-interaction
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml exec --user www-data nextcloud-fpm php occ maintenance:mode --off
----

Verify that warning disappeared.

If there are any other warnings, refer to the Nextcloud Admin Guide for resolutions.

==== Editing Nextcloud Config File
Edit the `/srv/nextcloud/html/config/config.php` file and add/modify the following parameters:

./srv/nextcloud/html/config/config.php
[subs="attributes+"]
----
'loglevel' => 1, # <1>
'overwrite.cli.url' => 'https://{SB_NEXTCLOUD_DOMAIN}:{SB_NEXTCLOUD_PORT}', # <2>
'htaccess.RewriteBase' => '/', # <3>
'default_language' => 'en',
'default_locale' => 'en_CA',
'knowledgebaseenabled' => false, # <4>
'token_auth_enforced' => true, # <5>
'default_phone_region' => 'CA' # <6>
----
<1> Sets log level to _info_.
<2> This and the next line will enable pretty URLs (essentially eliminating `index.php` from the URLs).
More info: https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html#pretty-urls.
<3> Same as above.
<4> This line disables arguably useless knowledge base page.
<5> Enforces token authentication for API clients for better security (will block requests using the user password).
<6> Set to your country code (more in the Nextcloud documentation).

Next, run the following command:

----
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml exec --user www-data nextcloud-fpm php occ maintenance:update:htaccess
----

And restart Nextcloud:

----
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml restart
----

Refresh the Nextcloud page and verify that pretty URLs work.

==== Background Jobs, Email Delivery
Navigate to _Settings -> Basic settings_ page.

Make sure Background Jobs scheduling is set to *Cron* and last run was within 15 minutes.

Also, on this page you can configure Email server parameters and test email delivery.

==== Access to NFS Share
It may be convenient to be able to access some directories that are shared with NFS from the Nextcloud.
It can be done with the "`External storage support`" Nextcloud app,
that allows mounting local directories inside the Nextcloud.

However, since Nextcloud is running inside a container, it is isolated from the host file system
and won't be able to access the NFS directories unless they are explicitly mounted inside the container.

To mount some directories into the Nextcloud container,
edit the `/root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml` file and append the directories to the
`volumes` list of the `nextcloud-fpm` service. For example:

./root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml
----
...
nextcloud-fpm:
  ...
  volumes:
    ...
    - /srv/nfs/videos:/nfs/videos
    - /srv/nfs/photos:/nfs/photos
...
----

To apply changes do:

----
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml stop
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml kill nextcloud-fpm
sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml up -d
----

To add these directories to Nextcloud navigate to _Settings -> External Storages_ and add two
"`Local`" storage entries for `/nfs/videos` and `/nfs/photos`.

===== Permissions
There are some permissions issues when accessing files created via NFS from the Nextcloud and vice versa.

In particular, files created inside NFS directories from the Nextcloud will be owned by `www-data:www-data` (`{SB_WWW_DATA_UID}:{SB_WWW_DATA_GID}`)
and with default `umask` will only allow modifications by the owner.
Thus, users accessing these files over NFS won't be able to modify them.

The permissions/ownership for such files can be adjusted with the following command:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo find /srv/nfs -uid {SB_WWW_DATA_UID} -exec chown {SB_USER}:{SB_NFS_GROUP} \{} \; -exec chmod g+w {} \; -exec echo {} \;
----

This example command changes ownership for all files under `/srv/nfs` directory that are currently owned by UID `{SB_WWW_DATA_UID}`,
to be owned by your user and `{SB_NFS_GROUP}` group, and also adds write permissions to the group.

There is a similar issue with the files created via NFS and accessed via Nextcloud.
Such files by default will have ownership `{SB_USER}:{SB_USER}` and won't be modifiable by the Nextcloud
(unless your `umask` allows modification by everyone).
One way to allow modifications from the Nextcloud is to set ownership to `{SB_USER}:{SB_NFS_GROUP}`,
which can be done with the following command:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo find /srv/nfs -user $USER -group $USER -exec chgrp {SB_NFS_GROUP} {} \; -exec echo {} \;
----

IMPORTANT: When creating files from outside of the Nextcloud (e.g. over NFS), the files won't be immediately visible
in the Nextcloud. Similarly, the changed permissions on such files won't be immediately noticed by the Nextcloud.
To force Nextcloud to rescan the files use the following command:
`sudo docker compose -f /root/silverbox/containers/nextcloud/docker-compose.yml exec --user www-data nextcloud-fpm php occ files:scan admin`

If desired, the permission correction can be automated with `inotify-tools` or similar tools

==== Security Scanning
It may be useful to run some security scanners against the Nextcluod.
Here are some example:

Nextcloud Security Scanner::
https://scan.nextcloud.com.
SSL Labs Scanner::
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest. Note that it only works over default HTTPS port 443, so to use it
you can temporary change port forwarding rule to forward from external port 443 to internal port `{SB_NEXTCLOUD_PORT}`.
ImmuniWeb SSL Scanner::
https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl

==== Reduce Autovacuum Frequency
This is completely optional step, but it may help to minimize disk writes.
In the default configuration, PostgreSQL autovacuum runs every minute,
which I find extremely excessive for my limited Nextcloud use.
Running it so frequently produces excessive disk writes by the `postgres: stats collector` process.

To reduce autovaccum frequency, edit the `/srv/nextcloud/db/postgresql.conf` file and change the
`autovacuum_naptime` parameter to desired value, for example:

./srv/nextcloud/db/postgresql.conf
----
autovacuum_naptime = 15min
----

Restart the Nextcloud database for the setting to take effect.
