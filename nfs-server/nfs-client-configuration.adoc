=== NFS Client Configuration
This section describes how to configure NFS client on the client PC (instructions are for Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop).

==== Installing NFS Client
To install NFS client do:

----
sudo apt install nfs-common
----

==== Enabling User ID Mapping
IMPORTANT: It is not clear whether these steps are really required or not,
as it seems like the ID translation works even without these module parameters.

Create the `/etc/modprobe.d/nfs.conf` file with the following content:

./etc/modprobe.d/nfs.conf
----
options nfs nfs4_disable_idmapping=0
----

Reboot the system, and verify that ID mapping is *not* disabled by executing:

----
sudo modprobe nfs
cat /sys/module/nfs/parameters/nfs4_disable_idmapping
----

Which should return `N`.

==== Creating Kerberos Principal
First, add Kerberos principal on the server for the client machine,
and save it to a separate keytab file (do these commands on the server):

[subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo kadmin.local
addprinc -randkey nfs/client-pc.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN} # <1>
ktadd -k /root/krb5.keytab nfs/client-pc.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN} # <2>
----
<1> Replace `client-pc.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}` with your client PC FQDN.
<2> Same as above.

Then move the `/root/krb5.keytab` file to the client PC to `/etc/krb5.keytab`.

On the client PC, assign proper ownership and permissions to the keytab file:

----
sudo chown root:root /etc/krb5.keytab
sudo chmod 600 /etc/krb5.keytab
----

Next, on the client PC edit the `/etc/default/nfs-common` file and change/add the following lines:

./etc/default/nfs-common
----
NEED_GSSD="yes"
----

Reboot the client PC and verify that the `rpc-gssd` service is now running:

----
sudo systemctl status rpc-gssd.service
----

==== Disabling Unused Services
The `rpcbind` service will be running (and listening on some ports),
even though it is not needed for NFSv4.
To disable it do:

----
sudo systemctl stop rpcbind.service rpcbind.socket
sudo systemctl disable rpcbind.service rpcbind.socket
sudo systemctl mask rpcbind.service rpcbind.socket
----

Reboot the system and verify that the `rpcbind` service is not running anymore.

==== Creating NFS Share Group
Create the same `{SB_NFS_GROUP}` group on the client machine, and add your user into it:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo groupadd {SB_NFS_GROUP}
sudo usermod -a -G {SB_NFS_GROUP} {SB_USER}
----

NOTE: There is no need to synchronize UID/GID for the user and group between server and client,
because ID mapping process in NFSv4 is name based, rather than UID/GID based.
It is important to make sure that the user and group have the same names on server and client.

==== Performing Test Mount
Create the `/mnt/nfs` directory:

----
sudo mkdir /mnt/nfs
----

To test that everything works, perform a test NFS mount with:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo mount -t nfs4 -o proto=tcp,port=2049,sec=krb5 silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}:/ /mnt/nfs -vvvv
----

The output should look something like this:

----
mount.nfs4: timeout set for ...
mount.nfs4: trying text-based options 'proto=tcp,port=2049,sec=krb5,vers=4.2,addr=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx,clientaddr=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'
----

Try accessing the mount as root user by doing `sudo ls /mnt/nfs`.
You should see `Permission denied` message as the root
user is mapped to `nobody:nogroup` and don't have permissions to access the share.

Now try accessing the share as your user by doing `ls /mnt/nfs`.
You should see either `Permission denied` or `Stale file handle` message, because your user don't have Kerberos ticket.

Finally, do `kinit` to obtain the Kerberos ticket for your user and try accessing share again. It should work now.

TIP: It is worth at this point to do some testing by creating files to make sure ID mapping works properly (both ways)
and user/group ownership is assigned correctly.

==== Automatic NFS Share Mount
This section describes how to setup automatic mounting of the NFS share on your user login (without any interaction).

The first step is to configure an automatic mount of the NFS share on boot.
To do this, append the following line to the `/etc/fstab` file (on the client PC):

./etc/fstab
[subs="attributes+"]
----
silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}:/ /mnt/nfs nfs4 proto=tcp,port=2049,sec=krb5,lazytime,auto,_netdev,x-gvfs-show 0 0 # <1>
----
<1> Replace `silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}` with the actual server FQDN.

NOTE: The `x-gvfs-show` option will make NFS share to appear in Nautilus file manager panel automatically.
If you are not using Nautilus you can remove this option.

NOTE: If you prefer NFS share to be mounted only on first access, change `auto` parameter to `noauto`
and add `x-systemd.automount` parameter (for additional options, refer to systemd.mount documentation).

With this change in the `fstab`, the share will be mounted on boot using credentials from the `/etc/krb5.keytab` file.
However, since this keytab only contains machine key, it won't allow any access to the content of the share.

The next step is to export your user's Kerberos key into a separate keytab file,
and create a user Systemd service which will do `kinit` for your user automatically on login.
Since this `kinit` will use key from the user's keytab file, no interaction (such as entering password)
will be required.

NOTE: Another (and, perhaps, a more convenient) way to automatically do Kerberos authentication on login
is to use `pam-krb5` PAM module.
If your Kerberos principal has the same password as your local user, you can install `pam-krb5`
and add the following line (after line for regular auth) to appropriate configuration file
under `/etc/pam.d` (depends on the distribution): `auth optional pam_krb5.so minimum_uid=1000 use_first_pass`.

To export your principal's key, run the following commands on the server:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
sudo kadmin.local
ktadd -k /root/krb5.keytab {SB_USER}
----

Move the `/root/krb5.keytab` file from the server to the client PC, for example under your users home `.config`
directory: `~/.config/krb5.keytab`.

IMPORTANT: It is important to have either full disk encryption or at least user's home directory encryption,
since the Kerberos principal key will be stored on disk.

Change permission on this file so that only your user can read it:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
chown {SB_USER}:{SB_USER} ~/.config/krb5.keytab
chmod 400 ~/.config/krb5.keytab
----

Create directory (on the client PC) for user Systemd services, if it doesn't exist yet:

----
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/systemd/user/
----

Inside this directory, create `nfs-kinit.service` file with the following content:

.~/.local/share/systemd/user/kinit.service
----
[Unit]
Description=Perform kinit automatically

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "kinit -r 7d -k -t ~/.config/krb5.keytab $USER" # <1>

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
----
<1> Replace `7d` with the value of the `max_renewable_life` option that you set in the `kdc.conf` file on the server.

Enable this service, so it will start automatically on login:

----
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable kinit.service
----

Reboot the system and verify that you can access the content of the NFS share.

NOTE: Since the service only started on login, if the user session will last longer than `max_renewable_life`,
the Kerberos ticket will eventually expire.
If you planning on having long user sessions, you can either increase `max_renewable_life` or make this service
run periodically to obtain a new ticket before old one expires.

NOTE: If user's home directory is encrypted, the Systemd service won't start on login.
It appears that user Systemd services are scanned before home directory is mounted and thus Systemd won't see
the service.
The only workaround I found for this is to add `systemctl --user daemon-reload` and
`systemctl --user start kinit.service` commands to the script that runs after user login
(it will depend on your system, but in Gnome it can be set with "`Startup Applications`").
