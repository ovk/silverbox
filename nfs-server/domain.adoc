=== Domain
This section describes how to configure internal (local) domain for the LAN, that is required to configure
Kerberos realm in the next step.

The internal domain will be direct subdomain of your domain `{SB_DOMAIN_NAME}`
and in the document will be referred as `{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}`.
For example, if your domain is `example.com`, the internal domain could be `home.example.com`.

Before proceeding to creating local zone for the internal domain, create an address reservations
on your DHCP server for all the client devices that will be in the domain (or configure static IP addresses).

==== Configuring Local DNS Zone
To create local DNS zone for your internal domain,
edit the `/etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/dns-config.conf` file
and append the following content under the `server` section:

./etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/dns-config.conf
[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
local-zone: "{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}." static # <1>
local-data: "silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}. IN A {SB_IP}" # <2>
local-data: "client-pc.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}. IN A \{CLIENT_PC_IP_ADDR}" # <3>
local-data-ptr: "{SB_IP} silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}" # <4>
local-data-ptr: "\{CLIENT_PC_IP_ADDR} client-pc.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}" # <5>
----
<1> Replace `{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}` with your internal domain name.
Dot at the end is required.
<2> This is forward DNS record for the server. It assumes the server FQDN in the internal domain is
`silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}`, but you can change it of course.
<3> This is an example forward record for the client PC.
You can add as many records as you need, for each device you have.
<4> This is reverse DNS record for the server.
<5> This is an example reverse record for the client PC.

Restart the DNS server:

----
sudo systemctl restart unbound.service
----

Make sure you can resolve all records that were added using FQDNS and IP addresses. For example:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
nslookup silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}
nslookup client-pc.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}
nslookup {SB_IP}
nslookup \{CLIENT_PC_IP_ADDR}
----

==== Configuring Server Domain and FQDN
Since the server uses static network configuration, its domain needs to be configured manually.
To do this, edit the `/etc/resolv.conf` file and add the following line:

./etc/resolv.conf
[subs="attributes+"]
----
search {SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN}
----

Verify that resolution by host name only works:

----
nslookup silverbox
nslookup client-pc
----

To configure server's FQDN edit the `/etc/hosts` file and insert FQDN before host name in the record for `127.0.1.1`.
So the line for `127.0.1.1` should look something like this:

./etc/hosts
[subs="attributes+"]
----
127.0.1.1   silverbox.{SB_INTERNAL_DOMAIN} silverbox
----

To verify that FQDN is set correctly check the output of the `hostname -f` command: it should print FQDN.

==== Configuring Client's Domain and FQDN
If clients use DHCP, the domain can be easily configured on the DHCP server and thus it will be automatically
pushed to the client devices.
If static network configuration is used, then domain will have to be configured manually
(the actual instructions will depend on the client OS).

The FQDN configuration will also differ depending on the client OS, but for the Ubuntu 18.04 it is identical
to FQDN configuration on the server.

Once domain and FQDN configured on client PC, verify that it works (using `nslookup` or similar command)
and that both client and server can resolve each other names (both short and FQDN).
