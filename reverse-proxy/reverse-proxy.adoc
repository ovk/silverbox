== Reverse Proxy
There are some services described in this guide (such as Monit Web UI or Transmission Web UI)
that are internal and only intended to be accessible from inside the home (LAN) network.
In addition, you may want to install some other services, not described in the guide, which should only be accessible from inside.
As described in this guide, the suggested way of accessing such services securely (with authentication and encryption)
is by establishing an SSH tunnel to each service first, and then accessing the service over the tunnel.

While this approach works, it may become quite inconvenient to access internal services this way, especially for the larger number of services.
This section describes an alternative approach: using internal reverse proxy to provide access to all internal services in secure way.
