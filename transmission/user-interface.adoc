=== User Interface
Transmission has web based user interface that is exposed outside of the Docker container.
However, it is exposed on the localhost only, so it is not accessible from the outside.

To access Transmission web UI securely first SSH tunnel needs to be created (similarly to how Monit UI is accessed).
For example, from the client PC establish a SSH tunnel:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
ssh {SB_USER}@{SB_IP} -N -L 127.0.0.1:\{LOCAL_PORT}:127.0.0.1:{SB_TRANSMISSION_PORT}
----

Here `\{LOCAL_PORT}` is port on which SSH will be listening on the client PC.
Web interface now can be accessed on the client pc at `http://127.0.0.1:\{LOCAL_PORT}`.

To create this tunnel in more convenient way, you can add the following entry to your SSH config file `~/.ssh/config`:

.~/.ssh/config
[subs="attributes+"]
----
host silverbox-transmission-ui-tunnel
    HostName {SB_IP} # <1>
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/silverbox-key
    LocalForward 127.0.0.1:\{LOCAL_PORT} 127.0.0.1:{SB_TRANSMISSION_PORT}
----
<1> IP can be replaced with the server FQDN.

Now the tunnel can be established simply with:

----
ssh -N silverbox-transmission-ui-tunnel
----
