=== Monitoring
To monitor Firefly III status with Monit create the `/etc/monit/conf.d/70-firefly` file with the following content:

./etc/monit/conf.d/70-firefly
[subs="attributes+"]
----
# Containers status
check program firefly_app with path "/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/container_status.sh firefly-app .State.Status running"
  if status != 0 for 5 cycles then alert

check program firefly_db with path "/usr/local/etc/monit/scripts/container_status.sh firefly-db .State.Status running"
  if status != 0 for 5 cycles then alert

# HTTP
check host firefly with address localhost every 5 cycles
  if failed port {SB_FIREFLY_PORT} protocol http request / status = 302 for 2 cycles then alert # <1>
----
<1> Replace `{SB_FIREFLY_PORT}` with the actual value.

Restart Monit and verify that Firefly III monitoring is working.
